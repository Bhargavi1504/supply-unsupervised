Unsupervised Learning:

Clustering: warehouses, products, suppliers

Anomaly Detection: on shipment delays/losses

Pattern Mining: transport type vs delays

Dimensionality Reduction: for visualization



Cluster Warehouses: Goal: Identify warehouse groups by dispatch volume, experience, etc. ‚Üí Algorithms: KMeans, DBSCAN, Hierarchical, GMM

Detect Shipment Anomalies Goal: Flag unusually long delays or lost shipments ‚Üí Algorithms: Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Z-score

Mine Frequent Patterns Goal: Which product categories or transport types are often delayed? ‚Üí Apriori, FP-Growth (after transforming categorical data)

Visualize with PCA/UMAP Goal: Reduce high-dimensional relationships (e.g., suppliers or products) to 2D ‚Üí PCA, t-SNE, UMAP



üéØ Objective: To simulate a multi-level supply chain system and apply all major unsupervised algorithms to:

Cluster warehouses & routes

Detect anomalies in delivery

Mine patterns in item movement

Perform dimensionality reduction for visualization

Understand supplier-product distribution

üóÇÔ∏è Your 4-Table Dataset Design (Synthetic)

warehouses warehouse_id location size_sqft storage_type avg_dispatch_per_day manager_experience
storage_type: cold/dry/frozen

Add noise to avg_dispatch_per_day to simulate inconsistencies

products product_id category weight_kg perishability_score supplier_id
perishability_score: 0 (non-perishable) to 1 (very perishable)

shipments shipment_id product_id warehouse_id dispatch_time arrival_time distance_km transport_type delivery_status
delivery_status: On-Time / Delayed / Lost

Use timestamps to compute duration and detect anomalies

suppliers supplier_id region avg_rating total_products_supplied compliance_score
compliance_score: Quality assurance from 0 to 1

üß† What You'll Perform: ‚úÖ 1. Data Generation Use distributions:

normal, uniform, poisson, beta for realistic simulation

Inject delays, lost shipments, and outliers to simulate anomalies

‚úÖ 2. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering Join tables using appropriate keys

Extract:

Delivery duration

Delay ratios

Warehouse efficiency metrics

Supplier risk score (based on delivery issues)

‚úÖ 3. Clustering Algorithms Cluster Warehouses based on:

Dispatch rate

Distance served

Delay %

Manager experience

Apply:

KMeans (for interpretable clusters)

DBSCAN (density-based for detecting isolated warehouses)

GMM (probabilistic distribution of cluster membership)

Hierarchical Clustering (visual dendrogram of clusters)

‚úÖ 4. Dimensionality Reduction PCA to find key components (e.g., "warehouse performance index")

t-SNE or UMAP for 2D visualization of high-dimensional metrics

NMF if dealing with sparse matrices

‚úÖ 5. Anomaly Detection Use on shipment & delivery data:

Isolation Forest: Identify late/missing shipments

LOF (Local Outlier Factor): Spot inefficient transport routes

Visualize anomalies over time

‚úÖ 6. Market Basket / Pattern Mining Adapted for supply chain:

Identify frequent product-shipment combinations

Apply:

Apriori

FP-Growth

Lift/Confidence to find strong rules:

e.g., If product X & Y shipped together ‚Üí Delay risk ‚Üë

‚úÖ 7. Optional Recommender Suggest optimal warehouse-product assignments:

Based on perishability, capacity, and past delay patterns

Use:

#not done

Matrix factorization (NMF)

KNN similarity between products & warehouses

üìà Dashboard Idea Create a Streamlit or Power BI app:

Delay heatmap by region

Cluster-wise warehouse performance

Top product patterns per supplier

Visualize anomaly timelines

Rare topic (supply chain + unsupervised ML)
